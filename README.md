Texas Hold'Em Poker P2P Game
=========

This application is meant to be a P2P application that is designed to work without a central server.

Right now, the application is set up in Play, but I may move this to Meteor.js or node.js.

Most of the functionality, if you are interested, lives in the public/javascripts folder.

Just starting to get most of the logic in place, plus unit tests.
