Texas Hold'Em Poker P2P Game
=========

A P2P Poker application that is designed to work without a central server.

Most of the functionality, if you are interested, lives in the public/javascripts folder.

To start the game, start up a http server in Python using "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" in the public directory. 
That being said, any http server will do.

The game should be accessible from http://localhost:8000/game.html.
